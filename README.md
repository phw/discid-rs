## About
discid provides Rust bindings for the MusicBrainz DiscID library [libdiscid](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid).
It allows calculating DiscIDs (MusicBrainz and freedb) for Audio CDs. Additionally
the library can extract the MCN/UPC/EAN and the ISRCs from disc.

This library is currently in early development and the API may still change.

## Requirements
* libdiscid >= 0.6.0

## Usage

### Read only the TOC

```rust
use discid::DiscId;

// Specifying the device is optional. If set to `None` a platform
// specific default will be used.
let device = Some("/dev/cdrom");
let disc = DiscId::read(device).expect("Reading disc failed");
println!("ID: {}", disc.id());
```

### Read the TOC and ISRCs

```rust
use discid::{DiscId, Features};

let disc = DiscId::read_features(None, Features::ISRC).expect("Reading disc failed");
println!("Disc ID: {}", disc.id());

for track in disc.tracks() {
    println!("Track #{} ISRC: {}", track.number, track.isrc);
}
```

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/discid/latest/discid/) for details.

[examples/](https://github.com/phw/rust-discid/tree/master/examples) directory.
